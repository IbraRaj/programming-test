# Question 4

Note: The answer to this question should be in a pull request (PR) to your repository. The PR should include a markdown file named `answer4.py` (or other suitable extension) with the answer to the question.

Provide an object-oriented design for card games. You should include classes for a deck of cards, a hand of cards, and a card itself. You should also include methods for shuffling the deck, drawing a card, and returning the number of cards left in the deck. You do not need to provide method implementations, just classes with their methods and properties.
